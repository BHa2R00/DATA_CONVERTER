Command: report_power -file DATA_CONVERT_power_routed.rpt -pb DATA_CONVERT_power_summary_routed.pb -rpx DATA_CONVERT_power_routed.rpx
WARNING: [Power 33-232] No user defined clocks were found in the design!
Resolution: Please specify clocks using create_clock/create_generated_clock for sequential elements. For pure combinatorial circuits, please specify a virtual clock, otherwise the vectorless estimation might be inaccurate
